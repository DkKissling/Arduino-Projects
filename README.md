# Arduino Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of Arduino projects spanning various areas such as sensors, remote control, robotics, security systems, and weather stations. Each project is contained in a separate `.ino` file and is ready to be uploaded to a compatible Arduino board.

## Projects

The following projects are available in this repository:

1. **AUTO.ino**: Project related to the control of an autonomous vehicle or robot.
2. **boton.ino**: Example of using a button to control some functionality.
3. **Control remoto IR.ino**: Implementation of an infrared remote control using an IR receiver.
4. **Estación meteorológica.ino**: Project that collects and displays weather data such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed.
5. **parpadeo.ino**: Basic example of how to make an LED blink.
6. **Robot seguidor de línea.ino**: Project that controls a robot capable of following a line on the ground.
7. **semaforo.ino**: Simulation of a traffic light using LEDs.
8. **semaforo_con_boton.ino**: Variant of the traffic light that uses a button to change the state of the traffic light.
9. **Sensor de temperatura.ino**: Project that reads and displays the temperature using a temperature sensor.
10. **Sistema de seguridad con alarma.ino**: Implementation of a security system with an alarm activated by a motion sensor.
