# Arduino Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of Arduino projects spanning various areas such as sensors, remote control, robotics, security systems, and weather stations. Each project is contained in a separate `.ino` file and is ready to be uploaded to a compatible Arduino board.

## Projects

### 1. AUTO.ino
Project related to the control of an autonomous vehicle or robot.

### 2. Control remoto IR.ino
Implementation of an infrared remote control using an IR receiver.

### 3. Estación meteorológica.ino
Project that collects and displays weather data such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed.

### 4. Robot seguidor de línea.ino
Project that controls a robot capable of following a line on the ground.

### 5. Sensor de temperatura.ino
Project that reads and displays the temperature using a temperature sensor.

### 6. Sistema de seguridad con alarma.ino
Implementation of a security system with an alarm activated by a motion sensor.

### 7. boton.ino
Example of using a button to control some functionality.

### 8. parpadeo.ino
Basic example of how to make an LED blink.

### 9. semaforo.ino
Simulation of a traffic light using LEDs.

### 10. semaforo_con_boton.ino
Variant of the traffic light that uses a button to change the state of the traffic light.

## Requirements
